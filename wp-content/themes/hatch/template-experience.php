  				<h3>360&deg; Mentorship</h3>
  				<p>Mentoring is a Hatch cornerstone. HATCH is built around meaningful relationships. What began as top-down mentorship has evolved into a ‘360’ mentorship approach; bottom-up and peer to peer. We encourage — if not expect — all HATCH community members to mentor, share, and challenge one another. &nbsp;<a href="/mentorship/360-mentorship">Learn more about 360° Mentorships</a></p>
