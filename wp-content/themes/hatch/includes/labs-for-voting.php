  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>For decades, k-12 education has battled against "teaching to the test", yet through teacher and school ratings, teaching to the test is the norm. For the sake of each precious student and for the sake of having each year a diverse and empowered new generation of citizens, classrooms need to teach to the whole person not a test.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">

  <p>How might we make our K-12 educational systems produce skilled and confident people for our communities rather than test numbers?</p>

  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Standardized testing is a hot topic. They are great for politicians and affluent communities, but cause a narrowing of society. Teachers are supposed to teach to learning standards, but are under maximum pressure to adjust their instruction for students to produce high and higher standardized test scores. If students produce low or lower standardized test scores, the schools, the teachers, the students, and their ethnic community is stigmatized leading to externalized and internalized oppression. Standardized testing like the SAT, ACT, and State assessment of student performance exams have narrowed classrooms' focus on a limited skillset: English, math, and for some states science and history. Take for example California. California rates high schools only in 11 grade for college and career readiness using only one test, the CAASPP. The CAASPP only evaluates only English and math, and math requires a proficient level of English to understand each math problem. 

This test focus has caused our students nationwide to receive narrow-minded education, which each year has produced graduates to enter the workforce or college with a single set of skills or less. This continues to cause the narrowing the mind of the American Dream. Each beautiful child enters our mandated education experience with diverse potential that our society needs. Yet, through our current test-focused education system, their diverse potential is standardized to a single set. America is ripe for a change in educational focus but needs a think-tank consisting of leaders from a wide range of disciplines to produce a viable alternative to the narrowing the mind of America and its dream.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Needs</label>
  <p>High-stakes testing dictates national, state, district, school, and classroom practices and content. 

What is a viable alternative to evaluating schools and teachers that not not limit or included standardized tests?

State schools are transitioning away from SAT/ACT scores regarding their acceptance policies.

A current state trend only evaluates high schools college and career readiness based on the English and math attainment of one grade level (attainment over student progress). 

Students are entering the workforce and college with limited skills and mindsets.

Standardized tests create a one-size-fits-all, leading to results that cause to racial, religious, and socioeconomic stereotyping and oppression.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>Food & Beverage companies are having hard time to face young generations who are looking for healthier, more sustainable products. We are building a platform where Food & Beverage companies can globally test new SDG-focused products with young consumers, using a network of food services on university campuses. This foster user and planet-centered design in the food industry, as well as youth involvement into sustainable food innovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>How might we enable F&B companies to create and test SDG-focused products, while involving youth?</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Our planet is falling apart and food has a major role in it. 1/4 of the global greenhouse emission is generated by the food system. The industry is proved to be number one in terms of its impact on the achievement of the UN SDGs. And Generation Z is showing to care. There were over 2,500 youth climate strikes scheduled in over 163 countries on all seven continents: a total of 4 million young people. Veganism and vegetarianism is booming among young generations, as well as their obsession for sustainable ingredients and packaging. But the F&B industry don't have any way to talk with the up-and-coming consumers and craft new products around their needs and feedback. That's why almost 90% of new CPG products fail within two years. We are building a platform where F&B companies can globally test physical products with young consumers, using a network of food vendors on university campuses. We call each location in this network, a Future Food Living Lab. The client specifies locations, goals, type of product and deadlines, and it is matched with local vendors, who will temporarily integrate the products into their existing offering, in exchange for compensation. User interviews are run by local students, allowing them to have an extra source of income while being engaged with food and sustainability topics. This means youth empowerment, working education and food involvement. The client gets access to a dashboard with qualitative and quantitate data about its concept before launching it, being able to fine-tuning the product based on real market feedbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Needs</label>
  <p>Now that we have a pretty solid POC the project needs:
Raise seed funding
Grow the phisical locations, opening more FFLL, by signing agreements with local vandors
Hire a community manager to engage, educate and assist local students
Hire a Business Dev to grow the F&B client base
Digitalize part of the process, by building a web platform to facilitate the interactions among the different stakeholders</p>

<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>I am photographing an ancient symbol of peace, a single white rose, in the hands of 10,000 people from every country on the planet. The catalyse will be toured globally as a provocative & insightful contemporary art exhibition to challenge and inspire the global conversation for peace. Through the sale of artworks we aim to raise $100 million dollars for charities focused on furthering peace through childrenâs health, education, safety and wellbeing.

To date we have photographed 3,500 people in over 50 countries, from celebrities in the Hollywood hills, to people in the slums of India and His Holiness The Dalai Lama who has blessed the rose and project. Every human being has a voice, I aim to make the invisible visible and to give people a stage to align their voice with our collective purpose to evoke the conversation for peace.

  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>After 4+ decades in leadership and strategy positions in government, industry and non-profit sectors, I became an author to change the conversation around mentoring to make it more available, more inclusive, more structured, more egalitarian, and more effective.  I wrote "Growing Mentor Intelligence - A Field Guide to Mentoring" in 2014 to start that process combining my passion for mentoring with insights gained from deep and unique experiences in leadership, mentoring and diversity and inclusion. Following publication I began to offer workshops to organizations large and small - this work continues today.  I change the world one mentor relationship at a time, but I know that the real promise of this life work is to scale beyond my social media connections and word of mouth marketing to a global audience that desperately needs to hear this message.  Mentoring is a core enabler to every one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Spawned out of a program hosted by NASA, Urban Matrix One is utilizing satellite imagery, machine learning, and unique data sets to quantify the impact of projects focused on the built environment. We are working to utilize appropriate technologies to better inform capital markets to invest in more regenerative and sustainable projects through minimizing risk and making SDG impact explainable. 


Being able to quantify the impact of complex global systems is a challenge. Through the utilization of current and edge technologies how do we holistically quantify and empower capital markets to make better decisions in identifying and quantifying built environment investments?  

Spawned out of Singularity University in collaboration with NASA- Urban Matrix One created a company to harness satellite imagery, machine learning and unique data sets to help innovators, developers and capital markets make fast, actionable decisions concerning people, places, and things. In much of the world there are missing data layers in which can be a real challenge to identify the correlations between investments and impact of the UN Sustainable goals. 

The past 18 months we have been working on creating applications that will help Institutional Investors, Project Developers, NGOs, and Municipalities gather insightful correlations to economic, social and environmental categories. Through these insights and the inevitable challenge of climate change, we are creating tools for innovators and practitioners to make better decisions by utilizing explainable AI that takes into account multiple layers and holistic view of risk when funding built environment projects. 

With remote sensing, computation and space flight becoming less capital intensive, how might the data science and space industries inform capital markets to make better, regenerative decisions</p>

  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>In my current teaching assignment, I am tasked with creating authentic lessons, activities, and projects for a  Design class in middle and high school.  Currently, I am facing some design limitations that involve workspace and materials. Specifically, we are struggling with creating a safe workspace to create, build and follow through with design projects. I am also attempting to problem solve with a very limited public school budget and a demanding Design Technology curriculum and expectations set forth through an International Baccalaureate program in our district.  
My students often have lofty goals as they begin to identify local and global issues/problems that they want to solve.  With limited space and materials, we often bog down when it comes to building prototypes or canvassing solutions to change.  After demonstrating my success with students and teaching for 20 years in the district, I have gained the support of the administration and school board, but their hands are tied as well with budgeting and creating a space for future goals. Another component of this success, I believe, depends on building working relationships and partnerships with local and global professionals and organizations.   How might we continue to build authentic design projects with a limited budget and safe working space while tapping into student creativity and solving local and global problems? Bottom line... how do we make our classrooms representative of the working world by solving authentic problems and creating a collaborative world of change?</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>The Men's Story Project is a movement-building project which helps groups create and film powerful live events where diverse men publicly share personal stories that challenge masculinity norms and take a stand for healthy masculinities and gender justice. Founded in San Francisco in 2008, it is research-based and revolutionary -- a project where men are basically challenging and dismantling the patriarchy from within, by publicly sharing courageous personal stories that advance health and equality for all.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>The Men's Story Project helps groups around the world create live productions where diverse men share personal stories that take a stand for intersectional gender justice. There have been 28 live productions and two films thus far in the U.S., Canada, Chile, Gaza and the West Bank. It has been formally evaluated and found to have many positive impacts for both audience members & presenters. It's now time for the MSP to scale! How can we help the MSP grow to become a viral social phenomenon, with hundreds or thousands of new local productions each year, catalyzing a mass global emergence of men sharing stories that take a personal, public stand for gender justice?</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>The Challenge: In the U.S. and around the world, social ideas about masculinity contribute to challenges including men's violence against women and other men, bullying, homo/transphobia, HIV/AIDS, men's reduced seeking of physical and mental health care, and gender inequality. But public dialogue on masculinity is still quite rare â people often don't realize there's much to talk about, or that can be changed, as to how boys and men are socialized to be "men." 

The Men's Story Project (MSP) was founded by Dr. Jocelyn Lehrer in 2008 to address this need. The MSP helps groups create live story-sharing events, documentaries and social media where men and boys publicly explore social ideas about manhood - through the lens of their own life experience. MSP productions can be stand-alone or integrated with broader education programs. As a bold movement-building project, the MSP helps groups "crowdsource culture change" in social ideas about masculinity, in locally-led ways, via men's own voices and stories.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                               
In each MSP production, diverse men and folks who identify with maleness share true, personal stories with a live audience - on topics like family relationships; sexual assault and harassment; intimate partner violence; sexuality; gender identity; bullying; LGBTQ issues; sexual health; journeys of personal change; gender equality, and intersections with race and other aspects of identity. The presenters share their stories in diverse mediums (e.g., poetry, prose, music, dance). The stories are followed by a facilitated audience-presenter dialogue and resource fair. MSP presenters have included students, community members, athletes, veterans, artists, and others. 

Films and social media based on the live events yield locally-relevant educational tools, and the productions can also lead to the creation of ongoing groups through which men can continue learning and taking action. 

The MSP's live productions and films have been very strongly well-received, as reflected in collaborations with UN Women, Planned Parenthood Generation Action, and Amnesty International; CNN coverage; several university awards, and frequent audience feedback with terms like âraw,â "revolutionary," âhealing,â and "transformative." The MSP has a world-class Advisory Council (e.g., Van Jones, Jackson Katz, Esta Soler - President of Futures Without Violence) and is a project partner of Harry Belafonteâs Sankofa.org, which works with leading artists for social change. 

The MSPâs  work is rooted in public health research and intended for local implementation and evaluation by campuses, NGOs and other groups. An MSP Training Guide, license, training and coaching are available. The MSP social media platforms highlight the locally-led productions.

Our aim is for the MSP to spread widely, catalyzing a large-scale emergence of men around the world who are taking a personal, public stand for healthy masculinities, violence prevention, and social justice. 

Twenty-eight MSP live productions have taken place thus far at UC-Berkeley, UC-San Francisco, Emory University, University of Oregon, Brown University, La PeÃ±a Cultural Center (Berkeley, CA), St. Louis University, University of Minnesota, McGill University, the Nuyorican Poets CafÃ© (New York City), Circus OK (Santiago, Chile), and at Bethlehem University, An-Najah National University, Al Quds University, and community venues in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Needs</label>
  <p>The Men's Story Project has a sound research foundation and has been piloted a great deal, and is ready to be implemented at scale. For this to happen, its needs include: a stronger social media presence; strong publicity/PR strategies and implementation partners; introductions to celebrities, producers and a media distributor to create and film a new live celebrity MSP production; and introductions to funders who would like to help the MSP scale in the U.S. and abroad. Many groups in the U.S. and abroad have expressed interest in creating MSP productions and doing trainings-of-trainers; funding is a primary need for helping that happen.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>Plastic film packaging is the biggest ocean polluter and causes the most harm, but if a bio-material could both provide food safety and shelf life, and degrade in your backyard, the harm would cease, therefore we need to invent a new kind of thin film packaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>The new material must give companies the shelf life they want (2 years) and really degrade in backyard compost (2months).  Thin film packaging needs to be reinvented to meet these criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Thin film packaging is the most abundant and widely distributed type of plastic waste causing harm to people and the planet.  Communities may benefit from globalization, but it comes heavily packaged in plastic, which accumulates in neighborhoods in emerging where waste management does no exist.  Itâs a human health, sanitation, and quality of life problem.  What is needed is a better way to deliver goods to market, without the legacy of trash.

Companies want shelf life and food safety, so they will not give up on thin film plastic packaging because of its barrier properties.  Chip and candy wrappers, diapers, sachet packs, bags of all kinds, are useful to companies, but they wreak havoc on communities and the planet.

We the people and the biosphere want no harm done by our trash.  The worthlessness of film packaging makes it hard to expect people to collect, unless municipalities pay for it.  Cities can no longer subsidize poorly designed packaging, and the biosphere can no longer handle our garbage.

What if a new material, or combination of materials gives that food safety barrier, but when it enters your residential compost Iâd degrades in the same time scale as a banana peel?

These criteria are our challenge.</p>

  <p>The TEAL Tag: A wellness microchip worn by cattle in predator dense areas, measuring GPS, body temperature, and heart rate, and paired to a smart phone providing crucial, real-time information through the use of IoT technology. This tech will help locate deceased or sick livestock, alert when they might be stressed due to the presence of a predator, and would know immediately if an animal is dead, how, and where to find it. This system will revolutionize safer landscapes by decreasing encounters between humans, livestock, and wildlife and widen the platform of tolerance of diverse landscapes in agriculture. 
Equally important (if not more) is this project's support and enhancement of conservation and protection of key wildlife species across the globe, ultimately changing the way we live with wildlife/predators everywhere. While scalability may look small (cattle in predator country), it's scalable capacity reaches into all sectors of agriculture and wildlife management on a global level.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>The Bridge Faith Initiative is a human rights organization that educates elected officials, policymakers, media, advocacy organizations, faith leaders to advance a progressive national security strategy that prioritizes human security and diplomacy over war. Our pillars are Immigration, Peace and Justice:</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>We seek to cease endless war, mass atrocities and our global refugee crisis that is caused by our U.S. Foreign and Military policies and exacerbated by our Domestic Immigration policies. We urge that our U.S. legislators bring these policies in alignment with one another and with the end goals of human rights and peace and we want to better educate our citizens and faith communities on how these policies intersect so that we better understand how we impact violence, injustice and contribute to the destabilization of communities that contribute to our refugee crisis. 

As an emerging organization, we need to figure out how to best tell this narrative in a compelling way to legislators of all parties and how to enroll a network of leaders, influencers and faith communities to join with us in advocating for justice in global peace efforts and stemming the refugee crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>The Bridge Faith Initiative is a policy and educational organization that works to bring progressive faith voices through advocacy and grassroots activism to Washington DC. We believe in a world of peace, human rights, and democracy. Our faith has taught us that we are one people in an interconnected world. However, human actions try to divide us by spreading hate and fear of each other throughout the world. We acknowledge that the U.S has a leadership role to play and a responsibility in the area of building a just and peaceful world and that is why we are bringing our voices to Washington DC to ensure and offer just policies are in place.  

The U.S policy space is divided into Foreign Policy and Domestic Policy, Military Policy and Non-Military policy. Our focus areas are in the places where all of this intersects and becomes one. For example, the U.S foreign and military policy influences foreign wars, which in some instances perpetuate mass atrocities, which always cause people to flee their countries and seek safety causing grave implications for refugees. It is because many U.S. citizens are led to believe that these are separate policies funded separately so that the government can spend freely on policies that do not have peace and human rights as an end goal and claim that it has to take away money from these programs that support the vision of a just America to fund the other programs such as healthcare and social security. 

Our pillars are Immigration, Peace and Justice:

Immigration- We will work to:
	End Immigration Detention
	Begin rights-based immigration policy
Peace- We will work to:
	End forever wars and torture
	Begin Foreign Policy based on American Values not on military corporatism
Justice- We will work to:
	End mass atrocities</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>The Success Beyond School project is an ambitious effort to broaden our definition of what a successful life looks like for a young adult, help schools gather useful, real-time data on how their graduates are faring in the adult world, and develop new support systems and networks for these young people.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>Our school does a really good job of graduating students and getting them into college or careers. While we believe we are preparing them to succeed, the reality is that we have far less contact with them once they've graduated, and don't always know how they're doing or how we could better support them. We need meaningful, timely data on our graduates, and we need to do a better job of supporting them when they encounter challenges. How can we build a robust and engaged alumni community, track progress and outcomes, and meet the evolving needs of our graduates, all with minimal resources?</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>The Workshop School is high school focused on building real-world skills through authentic work and intensive community building. Through interdisciplinary project-based learning, internships, consultancies, service projects and youth entrepreneurship, we create learning environments that both demand and cultivate creativity, collaboration, self-awareness, work ethic, emotional intelligence, and agency. We do this work with a population that faces entrenched poverty, trauma, and discrimination.

Now in our seventh year, we've gotten to a place where we have high graduation and college acceptance rates, which is good news. But getting students into college or careers is only the beginning. We need to know how our graduates are doing, and we need to continue to support them as they transition to adulthood. Getting good data isn't just about how we collect it, it's about what we choose to measure.  We know that college and work matter, but so do wellbeing, agency, even happiness. When we put it all together, what does long-term success actually look like? Equally important, how do we know when our graduates need support, and how do we make sure they get it?

We need ideas, input, and suggestions about what success looks like for a young adult today. We need help identifying or building tools to stay connected with our alumni, incentivizing engagement and participation, gathering and analyzing data, and matching students with resources. We need fast, easy ways to identify and curate both partners and opportunities that would benefit our students. (Right now this is a 100% manual task.) And we need all of this to be simple, inexpensive, and highly engaging. 

Solving this problem would have a huge impact not only for our little school, but for ANY school looking to better understand how its students fare on the only metric that really matters - real life. It would also help high schools, colleges, employment and youth-serving organizations get better at supporting young people as they transition to independence and adulthood.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>Mama YOUniverse is a platform and in person facilitation for women in maximum security prison and jails. The program provides the space and tools to activate, elevate and support internal transformation to end violence from the inside so that it is reflected in our outer world.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>The challenge is changing our perception of those who are incarcerated, starting with themselves.  This is the seed of change.

People who have been labeled as bad or 'other' are those that need and deserve support, accountability, healing to end the cycle of violence.  The challenges faced in communities and in prison is often inherited - train tracks laid by past generations.  How do you stand against violence when it is all you have ever known?  This program holds space for a new internal conversation and paradigm to emerge where violence is transformed from anger and deep fear into forgiveness and then love.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>What does compassion, empathy and forgiveness in the brains of incarcerated individuals who are considered some of the most hardened criminals look like?  Mama YOUniverse wants to eventually answer this question.  How can we remember the goodness in ourselves so we can see and acknowledge that in others.  It starts in the prisons, considered one of the darkest corners of society.  This is where we can find the greatest potential for light. 

Mama YOUniverse is a in person facilitated program within jails and prisons to ignite healing from within. People on on the outside will come in and experience alongside incarcerated individuals the same transformational training. Often the prisons within our minds and hearts are the same as the concrete prisons. Together both civilians and incarcerated people will leave the trainings with the tools to break free from self limitation.  

The mission is to capture these stories and experiences to be shared on a media platform such as television / online media so that others can access these powerful stories and images as a pillar of hope for themselves. Think the transformational narratives in Queer Eye meets Orange is The New Black that features the first-person intimate stories of prisoners' lives. 

For a year, we have been operating in the jails.  Since the beginning, the support of the program has spread through not only the prisoners but also garnered the support of staff, warden and jail psychologists. Long term inmates are now requesting groups daily. "We have had 100% retention and a 1000% growth," states the sheriff who is advocating for in-person trainings so that a new paradigm of leadership and empowerment can come not only from the outside but through the inmates themselves.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>The Social Good Club is a digital content studio bringing together the internet's top influencers with the people and organizations working to save our planet to create entertainment content around the global solutions currently taking place, specifically targeted at the 12-25 age demo.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>Our biggest challenge is something that experts have been trying to figure out for 30 years. How do you change the language and messaging around climate change and our use of resources to take politics out of the conversation and bring humanity back into the global solutions? If this ship sinks, we'll all go down with it, regardless of party preference.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Society has changed. From tribal living to self-sufficient isolation. From vast Green Planet to The Arctic and The Amazon burning at the same time.

We're caught in an age of over-consumption and over-connection that has led to an epidemic of loneliness and isolation, creating a 
disconnection to the very communities and natural worlds we need for our survival. And, we don't know what to do about it. But, what if we did?

What if we could arm audiences with the knowledge and tools needed to create hope and community, reinforcing our mental and emotional stability in the face of this uncertainty, in order to live more fulfilling and sustainable lives? 

There are people and organizations, in communities around the world, creating better, more sustainable ways of living, for themselves and the planet. These innovations are not only helping to fight against some of our biggest global issues, and workin to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, but they are actually enhancing the quality of life for the people that have found and use them. 

The Social Good Club is working to accelerate the progress by simplifying the Sustainable Development Goals, amplifying what's being done, and empowering our audiences with the tools and action steps needed to play a major role in the future of our planet and live productive, sustainable lives.</p>

  <p>We are a fully funded (no cost to partners) all-female demonstration jump team using skydiving as our vehicle to capture attention, motivate and inspire women to live bold, brave lives of their own design. We seek to align with events and organizations that stand for social justice missions we want to help promote, at our core elevating the conversation and action around gender equality and equality at large.</p>

  <p>Please help me expand the original imagined reach and impact of this project... how can we leverage the in-person shows, content collected from that... how can I use my own skills as a speaker and front-facing leader to elevate this impact... please help me envision a more clear vision of this global impact and clarify the building blocks to get there... the players I might need in place to support our team and the execution of our larger mission and message... how our mission can be created now with such unprecedented financial backing such that it can continue beyond that support in the futureâ¦</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>Recently founded and am co-leading a fully funded professional skydiving demonstration jump team (Women's Skydiving Network Pro Team / WSN Pro Team) who's mission is to inspire and encourage women to live a brave life, to think outside any current limiting views they might have about what is possible for them and their lives to play big in any way they are called. Using skydiving as our vehicle to capture attention and lead by this example and using these public opportunities and values-aligned partnerships/outdoor events to elevate the conversation of gender equality and other messages of social justice, our goal is to create win-win PR opportunities for our partners and the messages and missions we are committed to using our voice and vehicle to promote. 

At the onset, we are focused on the 100-year centennial anniversary of the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution that granted women the right to vote in August 1920. We aim to bring awareness to this part of history, the worldwide mission of womenâs suffrage and the courage it took these women to literally stand day after day in opposition to the established systems set up to silence them. With this focus, our goal is to connect women today to what it took for this huge step in womenâs right to happen and the extreme value inherent in those human stories of struggle and courage to secure our rights. Our goal is to inspire action in women today to use their voices and vehicles for elevated positive impact in their own ways.

Beyond 2020, we look to expand our mission, supporting others in their efforts to better the world, be it through their commitments toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals or other values-aligned work, coupled with the tone and message of gender equality and the capabilities of women always being present in our mission.</p>

  <label>Brief Summary</label>
  <p>Alley-oop is a tech startup focused on strengthening relationships across generations. Our first product is a collection of challenges and activities - delivered virtually every month - intentionally designed for Dads & Daughters.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>While other companies have enabled us to more broadly expand our networks and "connect" to others around the world, often the depth in our closest relationships (especially inter-generationally) is lacking, leaving many people more isolated than ever before. Alley-oop is working to change that by strengthening relationships ACROSS generations. We are starting first with Dads & Daughters, a truly game-changing relationship given its significant benefits to both people involved. That said, Dads are a notoriously difficult consumer market to reach.  With this Lab Sprint, we're hoping the HATCH network can help us create an effective action plan for our partner and marketing strategy for the next 9 months. This time period is critical in order to keep investors engaged while we scale quickly to this targeted (but often neglected) Dad community before expanding to Grandparents & Grandchildren.</p>
</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Full Project Description</label>
  <p>At alley-oop, we are looking to enhance and inspire some of our most important relationships by exchanging perspectives and experiences across generational lines.
With our initial monthly subscription product, we are inviting Dads and Daughters to complete different challenges together (as a team). The challenges vary by both type (some are physical/athletic, others are more creative; some are fast-paced and dynamic, while others are more thoughtful and discussion-based), and time - with some as short as 15-20 min - keeping the teams engaged while still enabling them to work on their own schedules around work and other family priorities. Delivering the challenges virtually has allowed us to spend less capital on physical goods and more on marketing and partnerships. We've built a partner platform where partner companies can build challenges themselves (with our approval, of course), gaining insights and learning from these important Dad & Daughter audiences, while simultaneously helping to build a community of Dads who recognize the need for - and celebrate! - a deeper relationships with their Daughters.
Once alley-oop is more established with this initial product, we will expand both horizontally - with a variety of different product and experiential offerings, as well as vertically - to the much larger market for Grandparents & Grandchildren.  We're just getting started . . .</p>
