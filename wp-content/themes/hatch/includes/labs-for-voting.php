  <p>The global need, consumer demand and business value of implementing the Sustainability Design Goals (SDGs) is widely documented but the corporate path to get there is unclear.

  <p>The Men's Story Project is a movement-building project which helps groups create and film powerful live events where diverse men publicly share personal stories that challenge masculinity norms and take a stand for healthy masculinities and gender justice. Founded in San Francisco in 2008, it is research-based and revolutionary -- a project where men are basically challenging and dismantling the patriarchy from within, by publicly sharing courageous personal stories that advance health and equality for all.</p>

  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>We seek to cease endless war, mass atrocities and our global refugee crisis that is caused by our U.S. Foreign and Military policies and exacerbated by our Domestic Immigration policies. We urge that our U.S. legislators bring these policies in alignment with one another and with the end goals of human rights and peace and we want to better educate our citizens and faith communities on how these policies intersect so that we better understand how we impact violence, injustice and contribute to the destabilization of communities that contribute to our refugee crisis. 

As an emerging organization, we need to figure out how to best tell this narrative in a compelling way to legislators of all parties and how to enroll a network of leaders, influencers and faith communities to join with us in advocating for justice in global peace efforts and stemming the refugee crisis.</p>

  <p>We are in the very beginning stages of our formation. We are working with the pro bono office of Kilpatrick Stockton who has helped us incorporate and is in the process of filing for our 501c3 status.

We are developing our board and need help with by-laws and recruiting a skill-diverse board. We currently have 6 members on our board.
We need support in fundraising and a development plan and refining our strategic plan.
We are developing our website and could use tech and social media guidance. 
We would benefit from assistance in clarifying our narrative and ensuring our vision is expressed in an urgent and compelling way.</p>

  <p>Our school does a really good job of graduating students and getting them into college or careers. While we believe we are preparing them to succeed, the reality is that we have far less contact with them once they've graduated, and don't always know how they're doing or how we could better support them. We need meaningful, timely data on our graduates, and we need to do a better job of supporting them when they encounter challenges. How can we build a robust and engaged alumni community, track progress and outcomes, and meet the evolving needs of our graduates, all with minimal resources?</p>

  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>The challenge is changing our perception of those who are incarcerated, starting with themselves.  This is the seed of change.

People who have been labeled as bad or 'other' are those that need and deserve support, accountability, healing to end the cycle of violence.  The challenges faced in communities and in prison is often inherited - train tracks laid by past generations.  How do you stand against violence when it is all you have ever known?  This program holds space for a new internal conversation and paradigm to emerge where violence is transformed from anger and deep fear into forgiveness and then love.</p>

  <p>Our biggest challenge is something that experts have been trying to figure out for 30 years. How do you change the language and messaging around climate change and our use of resources to take politics out of the conversation and bring humanity back into the global solutions? If this ship sinks, we'll all go down with it, regardless of party preference.</p>

</div>
<div class="project-description lab-section">
  <label>Challenge</label>
  <p>While other companies have enabled us to more broadly expand our networks and "connect" to others around the world, often the depth in our closest relationships (especially inter-generationally) is lacking, leaving many people more isolated than ever before. Alley-oop is working to change that by strengthening relationships ACROSS generations. We are starting first with Dads & Daughters, a truly game-changing relationship given its significant benefits to both people involved. That said, Dads are a notoriously difficult consumer market to reach.  With this Lab Sprint, we're hoping the HATCH network can help us create an effective action plan for our partner and marketing strategy for the next 9 months. This time period is critical in order to keep investors engaged while we scale quickly to this targeted (but often neglected) Dad community before expanding to Grandparents & Grandchildren.</p>
